BOOK Ι.

Arianthe subversion of libertyin the republie,

Cicero retired to his Pompeian villa and devoted
himself to philosophieal pursuits. He there wrote
the following treatise on moral duties for the ben-
efit ol' his son, a student at Athens. This subject,
though a common one among the different seete,
belongs peculiarly to those who placed the chief
good in what is fit, os the Academica Peripatetics
and Stolos.

Cicero inclined to the opinions of the Stolos,
modified however according to his own judgment.

Section l. Cicero exhorts his son not to forget
his Latin, although he was in a Greek University‚
but to leam to write both these tangnagem‘oa·

comcs a philosopher and an orator.
