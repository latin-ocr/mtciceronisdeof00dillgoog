Nouus, 113

Cincius, one of the tribunes of the people, in order
to correct this abusa, proposed the law here men-
tioned, and he was supported in his motion by
Fabius Maximus.’' Dubois in loc.

13. 1. Cunctando. “By wiso delay.” Fabius
Maximus, in his contests against Hannibal, did not
fight in the open field like his predecessore, hut
continually harassed his enemy hy countermarches
and ambuscades, for which he received the sur·
name of Cunctator, the delayer.

13. 8. Tarentum recepisti. Salinatorcommand·
ed in Tarentum when the troops of Hannibal
gained possession of the town: upon which he re·
tired to the citndcl and gallautly defended it, until
the city was retaken by Fabius. Plut.

13. 214 net in inanibus cauum. “ His pane·
gyrio is in the hands of all.” The speech men-
tioned here was extant in the days of Plutarch, and
isstill read aad admired as a perfect model and
masterpiece ef Roman eloquence. It was cus·
somery at the funereis of illustrious persons, for
the nearest relation to speak an oration in honor
of the deceased. This practice, as several of the
Roman writers complain, tended very much to
corrupt the truth of history, as these panegyrice
which frequently imputed virtues and actious to
the object of thern which never existed, were too
ollen resoned to by historiens aa faithful docu-
menta and mernoirs. Cic. in Brut. liv. viii. ta
